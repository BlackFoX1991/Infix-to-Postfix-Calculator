# Infix-to-Postfix-Calculator
This is a Example of a Infix to Postfix conversion and finally evaluate the postfix.

This Method shows how to easily evaluate Expressions. Postfix is very useful if you want to create a Binary Tree and even abstract Syntax Tree which is interesting
if you into Lexer, Parser, Interpreter Stuff. This is the Reason i created a small Lexer with Token-Types in here.

For more Information just take a look at the Code, everything is commented to explain the Process
